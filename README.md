# Oerlemans' Ice Sheet Model

As a project during my last year in undergraduate school, I coded up a simple 1-dimensional ice sheet model, later including a GUI the following summer. Since then, it has been collecting dust in my files, so I have now decided to add it to my Github. This model is a replication of the Oerlemans 1981 ice sheet model. It includes a height and latitude-dependent mass balance, varying climate point (optional), and an adjusting bedrock. It is one of my older Python projects, and I do plan on adding improvements here and there in the future. In the meantime, enjoy using this model I have made!

## How to use

Simply open the .py file and run it. Make sure you have tkinter installed on your computer. From there, just follow the instructions on the GUI.
